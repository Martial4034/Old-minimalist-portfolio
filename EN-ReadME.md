## [French version of README.MD](https://github.com/Martial4034/Old-minimalist-portfolio/blob/main/README.md)


This is a clean and modern portfolio crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills and projects effectively and attractively. Created at the age of 13, this project was a personal challenge, particularly for creating the visual effect of my name, "MARTIAL".

### Concept
The main effect of the site is inspired by old film reels. It features an image made up of several 'M' letters which gradually transform to spell out my entire name. JavaScript animates this transformation by moving a small square across the image, simulating the movement of a film reel.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML** : Basic structure of the portfolio.
- **CSS** : Styling to achieve a clean and modern look.
- **JavaScript** : Scripting for the animation of the name effect.
